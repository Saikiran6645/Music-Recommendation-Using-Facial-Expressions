## Music-Recommendation-Using-Facial-Expressions
### Project Overview

This project is a Python-based application that uses OpenCV for real-time facial detection and a pre-trained deep learning model (fer2013_mini_XCEPTION.102-0.66.hdf5) to recognize and analyze facial expressions. By capturing live video feed from the userâ€™s webcam, it identifies the userâ€™s emotionsâ€”such as happiness, sadness, anger, or neutralityâ€”based on facial cues.

Once the emotion is detected, the application constructs a YouTube search query tailored to the identified mood. Using the webbrowser module, the application automatically opens relevant YouTube search results in the userâ€™s default browser, allowing them to access music that aligns with their current emotional state. The requests library further supports this functionality by enabling API interactions for a smoother YouTube search experience.

This project combines elements of computer vision and deep learning with web integration to create a personalized and interactive music recommendation system. It demonstrates the potential of AI-powered emotion detection in real-world applications, where user experience can be enhanced through real-time responsiveness and intelligent content recommendations.
